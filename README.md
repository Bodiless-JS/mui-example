# Examples of Integrating Bodiless/FClasses with Material UI

## Vanilla
For reference, we include a vanilla MUI card, copied from their docs.

- [MuiCardVanilla](./packages/muiExample/src/components/MuiCardVanilla/)

## Editable
We take the Vanilla card and make it editable by embedding core Bodiless editable primitives.

- [MuiCardEditable](./packages/muiExample/src/components/MuiCardEditable/)

## FClasses
We wrap the core Material card components in FClasses to allow easy extensibilty.
