# Examples of Integrating Bodiless/FClasses with Material UI

## Vanilla
For reference, we include a vanilla MUI card, copied from their docs.

## Editable
We take the vanilla card and make it editable by embedding core Bodiless editable primitives.

## FClasses
We wrap the core Material card components in FClasses to allow easy extensibilty.
